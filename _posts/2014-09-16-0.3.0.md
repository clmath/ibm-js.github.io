We just released 0.3.0 versions of both [delite](http://ibm-js.github.io/delite) and [deliteful](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful) projects.

We managed to get in there most of what was initially [planned]({% post_url /2014-08-25-0.2.0-0.3.0 %}), this includes in particular:

* update to store management to use latest release of [dstore](https://github.com/SitePen/dstore)
* first draft deliteful tutorial available [here](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/0.6.0/tutorial/index.html)
* new custom elements including [CheckBox](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/0.6.0/Checkbox.html), [Switch](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/0.6.0/Switch.html), [Toggle](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/0.6.0/ToggleButton.html) and [Radio](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/0.6.0/RadioButton.html)
* lots of fixes around delite templating & popup management
* add support for internal containerNode to delite/Container
* use of [Intern 2.0.1](https://github.com/theintern/intern/releases/tag/2.0.1) for deliteful unit & functional testing
* API doc is now available for [delite](http://ibm-js.github.io/delite/docs/api/0.3.0/) and [deliteful](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/api/0.3.0/) as well as for [decor](http://ibm-js.github.io/decor/docs/api/0.2.1/)
