Despite some of us having less time to contribute during the last month, we are happy to announce our 
[delite](http://ibm-js.github.io/delite) and [deliteful](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful) 0.4.0 releases.

Among the new features or enhancements of this release you will find:

* various enhancements related to dropdown and popups
* a new `customelement-attached` event is fired when a custom element is attached to the DOM, this typically allows
 another custom element to be notified of the upgrade of an element into custom element and its availability.
* a [ResponsiveColumns](https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/blob/master/docs/ResponsiveColumns.md) container
* a data source custom element: [Store](https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/blob/master/docs/Store.md) 
* a preview of a new [ComboBox](https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/blob/master/docs/Combobox.md) custom element, to be completed in next release.
* a brand new version of the [tutorial](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/0.6.0/tutorial/index.html)

There are quite a lot of other things in those releases. I will let you checkout the details of the 
[delite release notes](https://github.com/ibm-js/delite/releases/tag/0.4.0) and in particular the various 
renamings that might trigger incompatibilities if you already built some elements on top of 0.3.0 release. A notable 
one is the `delite/css` AMD plugin for loading CSS that has been moved to the 
[requirejs-dplugins](https://github.com/ibm-js/requirejs-dplugins) project where some other AMD plugins like `has` or `i18n` are
 already available. This means any use of `delite/css` must be changed to `requirejs-dplugins/css`.
 
Also as mentioned in my [previous post](http://ibm-js.github.io/2014/09/16/0.3.0.html) we now have pre-built versions available
as well. The change that happened in this milestone is that instead of loading a `boot` module for the built version
you have to load the `layer` module. The following code will load the built version and then gives you the ability to
load the actual modules you are using in your application:

```js
require["deliteful-build/layer", function (layer) {
  require(["deliteful/Toaster", "requirejs-dplugins/domReady!"], function (Toaster) {
    var toaster = new Toaster();
    toaster.placeAt("container");
    toaster.postMessage("message!");
  });
});
```

In the next release, hopefully coming end of November, we hope to stabilize some of the work introduced in 0.4.0,
in particular around ComboBox (see deliteful issue [#366](https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/issues/366) to [#371](https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/issues/371)) 
as well as add some new features like a [swapable view](https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/issues/183).
