Right in time for the week-end, we have new releases to announce, we actually tagged a 0.5.0 a few days ago but as 
we found a blocker issue when running cross-domain right after release, we came up shortly after with 0.5.1.

As usual just use bower to install the latest release:

```sh
bower install deliteful
```

Among the new features or enhancements of this release you will find:

* [SwapView](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/0.6.0/SwapView.html), a container custom element extending
`ViewStack` to provide interaction in order to navigate between the various stacked views  
* [ViewIndicator](http://ibm-js.github.io/deliteful/docs/0.6.0/ViewIndicator.html) a simple element enumerating the
views of a `ViewStack` and displaying which one is currently visible.
* additional improvements to [Combobox](https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/blob/master/docs/Combobox.md) element even
though we did not managed to complete all [what we had in mind](http://ibm-js.github.io/2014/10/24/0.4.0-counting.html) 
(more to come in 0.6.0).
* use of jQuery Core for DOM manipulation in [delite](http://ibm-js.github.io/delite/).
* upgrade store management to [dstore 1.0](http://dstorejs.io/)
* as part of the [requirejs-dplugins](https://github.com/ibm-js/requirejs-dplugins) 0.4.0 release, we added a nice `jquery` 
AMD plugin. If jQuery is not already present in your application, requiring a jQuery AMD module will actually load the
AMD module. Conversely if jQuery has already loaded in your application as a single JavaScript file, requiring a 
jQuery AMD module will do nothing and just use the already loaded jQuery. This is used by the delite work above.
* finally as part of the [ecma402](https://github.com/ibm-js/ecma402) 0.2.6 release we leveraged navigator.languages
when available to pick the best locale.

<!--more-->

If you have code that was running on 0.4.0 please be aware there are two known API incompatibilities in 
[deliteful](http://ibm-js.github.io/delite/):

* `CheckBox` module has been renamed to `Checkbox`
* `ComboBox` module has been renamed to `Combobox` and the corresponding custom element tag from `d-combo-box` to `d-combobox`

In the next milestone we hope to extend the use of jQuery for DOM manipulation to deliteful, as well as provide new
elements and enhance existing ones. You can keep an eye on the (moving) list of what we plan 
[here](https://github.com/ibm-js/delite/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.6.0) and 
[here](https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.6.0).

As usual if you find any issue with release just go to the github issue lists.
